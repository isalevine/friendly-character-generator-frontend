# Welcome to Friendly Character Generator!

**Friendly Character Generator** is an app for quickly and easily creating ready-to-use tabletop RPG characters, especially  for users that have no prior knowledge or experience! Currently, the generator is creating characters for **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition** only.

When creating a new character, users are asked simple and straightforward questions--basically "Do you prefer to fight or solve puzzles?" and "Do you like to deal lots of damage or heal people?"--and the app uses those answers to generate a customized character with a uniquely-generated backstory. **The goal is for users to have a usable, level 1 character sheet in less than 15 seconds.**

Additionally, users can create an account and log in to contribute new character Archetypes to the system for others to use!
  
The backend repo can be found here: [https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api)  

Feedback on the user interface can be provided here--thank you for contributing your thoughts!

## Highlights
### 1. [Check out the live app on Heroku!](https://friendly-character-generator.herokuapp.com/)
It may require a refresh to ensure that both the frontend and backend dynos are active on Heroku.

### 2. All Dungeons and Dragons character-creation system rules are [encoded into a single nested Ruby hash](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api/blob/5d3cc9a02af78375450675037717cd6be780745e/db/seeds.rb#L629)--and the pattern is easily replicable to allow other tabletop RPG systems to be parsed the same way!
In order for this app to work, the character-creation rules for a tabletop game must be easy to parse.

I manually distilled generic character-creation rules from across several games (Dungeons and Dragons, Exalted, World of Darkness), and encoded options into an easy-to-copy hash. This allows additional game systems to be added to the app!

### 3. Users are able to generate characters based on three simple questions, [none of which require any knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/forms/PowerForm.js#L34) or other tabletop RPG games.
Users enter their choices in a form, and those three values are able to find a matching character archetype in the database.

The character archetype has preferences and rankings for the types of skills, powers, and stats it can have.

### 4. The backend Rails app parses the character-creation rules, and [dynamically assigns available points](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api/blob/5d3cc9a02af78375450675037717cd6be780745e/app/services/character_generator.rb#L242) (and other decisions) based on both the specific game's rules and the type of character requested by the user.

### 5. All characters have a [semi-randomly generated backstory](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api/blob/5d3cc9a02af78375450675037717cd6be780745e/app/services/character_generator.rb#L488), based on the text gathered from the character sheet's skills, power descriptions, and other texts.
This text [generates a pool of individual words](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api/blob/5d3cc9a02af78375450675037717cd6be780745e/app/services/snippet_tag_generator.rb#L36), which are used to query tags in the database. 

These tags match the individual words to potential backstory snippets--[one or two sentence descriptions of a phase of the character's life](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api/blob/5d3cc9a02af78375450675037717cd6be780745e/db/seeds.rb#L921)--which are then randomly selected and compiled into a semi-cohesive story.

### 6. Users can immediately [print out their character](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/characters/ExtendedCharacter.js#L92)!

### 7. A form on the frontend allows users [to contribute new character archetypes to the database](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/forms/ArchetypeMakerForm.js#L7)!
This React form contains all the options for designing a game-system-agnostic character archetype, including:
* Ranking the priority for [character stats and skills](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/forms/ArchetypeMakerForm.js#L19)
* Setting [the playstyle responses from the user](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/forms/ArchetypeMakerForm.js#L92) that will lead to generating this particular character type
* [Game-specific parameters](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-frontend/blob/bfe4ffcaa74ecf9e49d0ed2e68cfd3435797fce0/src/components/forms/ArchetypeMakerForm.js#L51) (i.e. character traits specific to DnD, like armor class), which will not affect generated characters for _other_ game systems



## Overview
**To create a new character:**
* On the main page, click the "Create New Character!" button on the left-hand card. 
* Click the deck to flip the first question card. 
* As you select the multiple-choice answers, new questions will appear. 
* When you have answered all questions, click the "Create Character!" button.
* A new card will appear with your character's Archetype, portrait, and a "Show More!" button to see additional info. 
* Click the "Show More!" button and your character's stats, skills, powers, and backstory will display, along with a "Print!" button.
* Click the "Print!" button and a printer dialog box will open up in your browser.


## Install 
**To create a local version of this app:**
* Make sure you have npm or yarn installed.
* Clone this repo onto your machine. 
* ```cd friendly-character-generator-frontend``` to move into the folder.
* In your console, run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` to install Node packages.
* Make sure you have the Ruby backend cloned down, installed, and running on localhost:3000. [Directions can be found here.](https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api)
* Run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` to start the app on localhost:3001. **NOTE: You may need to /constants/index.js so that the API_URL points to "http://localhost:3001", instead of "https://friendly-char-gen-backend-api.herokuapp.com" where it is currently deployed!**
* Open your browser (Chrome recommended), and navigate to localhost:3001 to create characters and contribute new Archetypes!


## Release Notes

#### NEXT GOALS:
1. Refactor components/HTML for readability and screen-reader compatibility.
2. Add spell-selection to Archetypes with {spellcaster: true} attribute.
3.  Create tool to add Backstory Snippets to the database.
4. Create tool to add additional Game Systems to the character converter.
